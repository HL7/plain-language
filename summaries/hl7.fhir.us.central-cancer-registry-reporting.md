# General

This standard is a set of rules and best practices to help automate and streamline cancer reporting from healthcare providers to central cancer registries in the United States. It defines a method for EHRs to automatically send cancer-related information to registries, making the process faster and more accurate.

Cancer reporting is legally mandated in the US, but current processes for reporting from non-hospital providers often involve manual data extraction, leading to delays and potential errors. This standard addresses these issues by leveraging FHIR to provide a standard set of rules, format, and method to exchange cancer-related data, such as patient records, cancer diagnosis, and treatment. These rules follow federal programs, such as the [U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)+](https://uscdiplus.healthit.gov/uscdiplus), ensuring providers share data in a standardized way and in accordance with state and federal requirements. It aligns with [US Core](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1) and the [minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/) standard for cancer data exchange. It directly addresses legal requirements for cancer reporting in the USA. The standard also emphasizes adherence to security guidelines and HIPAA regulations to protect patient data. 

This approach benefits central cancer registries by providing timely, standardized data for improved surveillance and research. Healthcare providers can reduce manual reporting burdens, while EHR vendors and technology developers can create systems that support automated cancer reporting workflows.
