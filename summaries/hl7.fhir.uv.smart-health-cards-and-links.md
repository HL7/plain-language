# General
This standard defines SMART Health Cards and SMART Health Links, which are digital formats for representing and sharing verifiable health information. It aims to overcome limitations of paper records by providing a secure, tamper-proof, and easily shareable digital alternative.

SMART Health Cards can store various health data, such as vaccination records, test results, and insurance details. Users can share this information via QR codes, mobile apps, or web browsers. The standard emphasizes data privacy by only sharing necessary information for specific use cases.

SMART Health Links extend the capabilities to larger datasets, dynamic content, and access to APIs. The standard includes features for data integrity, authenticity verification, and the ability to revoke individual Health Cards if needed.

Key beneficiaries include patients, who gain better control over their health information, and healthcare providers, who can issue and verify Health Cards efficiently. Health information systems, public health agencies, and organizations needing to verify health information can also integrate and use these digital formats.

The standard utilizes FHIR resources and incorporates cryptographic signatures to ensure data security and interoperability.
