# General

This standard defines a method for efficiently exporting large healthcare datasets such as patient records or claims from FHIR-based systems. It addresses the need to transfer bulk data between software systems or between organizations that have appropriate data sharing agreements in place for purposes like research, population health management, and clinical quality measurement. Key beneficiaries include developers of FHIR servers, healthcare organizations, payer organizations, and researchers. The standard recommends the SMART Backend Services Authorization Profile for secure access management.
