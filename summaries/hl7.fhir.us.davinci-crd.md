# General
This standard aims to streamline insurance coverage determinations for healthcare services in the United States. It defines a real-time API that allows healthcare software to query a patient's insurance company and receive immediate feedback on coverage requirements in the background as providers create orders, book appointments, etc. This includes information about necessary documentation and whether the service or product is covered or needs prior authorization.  It provides optional support for conveying other decision support information such as alternative therapies and potential patient costs

The standard introduces a new approach using FHIR and [CDS Hooks](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cds-hooks) technologies to enable real-time, context-specific coverage discovery within a provider's EHR system. It addresses limitations of traditional insurance adjudication processes by operating on clinical orders and providing rapid responses.

Key features include FHIR-based data exchange, CDS Hooks for triggering queries at specific workflow pointsThe standard also defines custom extensions to convey coverage details and allows providers to customize the types of information they receive.

This approach benefits healthcare providers by providing immediate access to coverage information, potentially reducing administrative burdens and improving care delivery efficiency. It also aligns with the goals of value-based care by promoting transparency in healthcare delivery.
