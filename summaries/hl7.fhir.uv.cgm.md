The Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Implementation Guide provides a standardized way for computer systems to share blood glucose data from CGM devices, which people with diabetes commonly use.  For instance, it allows a patient to send their blood sugar reports from a CGM app to their doctor's electronic health record system or share data with a research study.  This guide helps patients, healthcare providers, and researchers exchange CGM data securely and efficiently, ensuring accurate and safe data use.
