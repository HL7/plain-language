# General

This standard aims to streamline the prior authorization process in the US healthcare system. It focuses on enabling electronic prior authorization requests and responses between healthcare providers and insurance companies. The goal is to reduce manual processes, improve efficiency, and accelerate authorization decisions.

The standard leverages FHIR to facilitate a more automated approach compared to existing methods. Key features include FHIR-based data exchange, a Claim $submit operation for sending authorization requests, and an intermediary role to translate between FHIR and X12.

The standard supports both real-time authorization decisions and "pended" responses where further review is needed. It also includes mechanisms for providers to be notified of updates to pended authorizations and to inquire about authorization status. Additionally, providers can cancel, modify, or add items to existing authorization requests.

Primary beneficiaries include healthcare providers, who experience reduced administrative burden and faster authorizations, and insurance companies, who benefit from streamlined processing and improved data accuracy. Patients may experience faster access to care due to expedited authorization decisions.

The standard aligns with HIPAA requirements and works in conjunction with other related standards to further automate the authorization process.
