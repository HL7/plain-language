# General

This standard aims to improve person-centered care by enabling healthcare providers and patients to focus on what matters most to each person receiving care. It provides a standard way for healthcare systems to share and track information about a patient's personal health goals and outcomes.

Goal-directed care is about working together to set and reach personal goals. It includes:
- **Identifying What Matters Most:** Patients, with support from caregivers and their providers, create personal goals.
- **Creating a Plan:** A plan is made based on these goals, including treatments, therapy, or lifestyle changes.
- **Tracking Progress:** Patients and providers use assessment tools to measure how well a person is reaching their goals and adjust care if needed.

This standard supports two ways of measuring progress on person-centered goals:
- **Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS):** A method where patients and providers set specific goals and track progress on a numbered scale.
- **Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROM):** Standard surveys where patients share their own experiences about their health and progress.

Healthcare providers, health & wellness coaches, patients, and caregivers all benefit from this standard. It enables better care that is focused on what matters most to each person and quality measures that are focused on achievement of person-centered goals.
