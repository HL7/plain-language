# General

The International Patient Summary is a minimal and non-exhaustive set of basic clinical data of a patient, specialty-agnostic, condition-independent, but readily usable by all clinicians for cross-border patient care. This summarized version of the patientâ€™s clinical data gives health professionals the essential information such as allergies, medications and problems needed to provide care in the case of an unexpected or unscheduled medical situation (e.g. emergency or accident). While this data is mainly intended to aid health professionals in providing unscheduled care, it can also be used to provide planned medical care (e.g. in the case of citizen movements or cross-organizational care paths).
