# General

This standard provides details on how to transform healthcare data from FHIR to the OMOP Common Data Model. It aims to bridge the gap between these two widely used formats in healthcare and research. The standard defines mappings between FHIR resources and OMOP data tables, focusing on commonly used EHR data.

By creating a standardized transformation process, the standard enables researchers and healthcare organizations to combine data from different sources more easily. It allows FHIR data to be converted into OMOP format, giving access to powerful analytical tools used in observational research.

The standard uses FHIR StructureMaps to define transformation rules, ensuring consistent and reliable data conversion. It also outlines a process for handling coded data, including mapping to standard OMOP vocabularies.  It also provides a lot of background on how to convert FHIR data to OMOP tables outside of the standard StructureMaps.

Key beneficiaries include researchers who can more efficiently conduct studies using real-world data, healthcare organizations looking to integrate their data with research systems, and data scientists who benefit from simplified data preparation and analysis processes.

This project is supported by the Vulcan FHIR Accelerator, indicating its relevance to broader efforts in healthcare interoperability.
