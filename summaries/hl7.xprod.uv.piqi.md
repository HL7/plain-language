# General

The Patient Information Quality Improvement (PIQI) Framework is a healthcare standard that helps organizations check whether their patient data is good enough to use for medical care and decision-making.

**The Problem It Solves** Healthcare organizations exchange patient information in many different computer formats. Each format traditionally required separate quality checks, making it hard to ensure consistent data standards across systems. As more patient data gets shared between hospitals, clinics, and other providers, this becomes increasingly complicated and time-consuming.

**How It Works** The PIQI Framework creates a single set of rules that can evaluate patient data quality regardless of the computer format being used. It examines data at the basic structural level and compares it against established healthcare data standards. The system then produces scorecards that show healthcare professionals whether their data meets quality requirements for specific uses.

**Benefits for Healthcare** Healthcare IT professionals and developers can now apply the same quality standards across different systems and data types. This consistency helps healthcare organizations make faster, more confident decisions about whether their patient data is reliable enough for clinical care. The framework's design allows it to work with various healthcare computer systems, making it easier for organizations to maintain high data quality standards while improving patient care through better information management.
