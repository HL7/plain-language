# General

This standard, called the US Public Health Profiles Library (USPHPL), aims to simplify public health information exchange in the United States. It provides standardized data structures for common public health concepts, reducing the burden on healthcare providers, EHRs, and public health agencies.

The USPHPL addresses the issue of redundant profile definitions across different public health reporting systems. It establishes a centralized library of reusable profiles, promoting consistency in public health data exchange. The standard leverages FHIR to define profiles, value sets, and extensions specific to public health reporting needs.

Key users include healthcare organizations, EHR companies, public health agencies, and researchers. Healthcare organizations use it to structure their public health data for reporting, while public health agencies use it to receive and analyze reports. The USPHPL aligns with broader healthcare standards like [US Core 6.1.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/) and incorporates elements from the [United States Core Data Interoperability+ (USCDI+)](https://uscdiplus.healthit.gov/uscdiplus) standard, ensuring compliance with federal regulations.

By standardizing public health data exchange, the USPHPL supports improved disease tracking and outbreak detection, contributing to better population health outcomes.
