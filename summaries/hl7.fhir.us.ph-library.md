# General

The US Public Health Profiles Library (USPHPL) is a standard that defines reusable FHIR profiles, value sets, and extensions commonly needed in public health reporting. It provides consistent data structures for public health information so that healthcare organizations, electronic health record systems, and public health agencies can exchange data in a uniform way.

USPHPL reduces duplication by offering a single library of profiles that can be used across different public health reporting systems. It builds on national standards, such as US Core 6.1.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/), and incorporates data elements aligned with the [United States Core Data Interoperability+ (USCDI+)](https://uscdiplus.healthit.gov/uscdiplus) initiative.  

By using shared profiles, public health systems can more efficiently send and receive structured data needed for case reporting and related activities.
