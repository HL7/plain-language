# General
This standard aims to improve how healthcare forms are created, filled out, and processed electronically. It focuses on reducing redundant data entry, enhancing data quality, and enabling different healthcare systems to work together more effectively.

The standard introduces several key features to modernize healthcare forms. It allows for modular questionnaires, where forms can be built from reusable components. Auto-population capabilities can fill in answers automatically using existing patient data. Adaptive questionnaires can simplify handling of complex questionnaires. The standard also defines methods for converting completed forms into other types of healthcare data.

Using this standard, form designers can create better designed, more efficient, and consistent questionnaires. Healthcare providers and patients can complete forms more easily, with less repetitive data entry. Healthcare systems can process and use the form data more effectively.

By standardizing these processes, the healthcare industry can move towards more streamlined data collection and improved information sharing, potentially leading to better coordinated care and outcomes for patients.
