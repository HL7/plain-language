# General
The HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) for NHSN Digital Quality Measure (dQM) Reporting provides a standardized framework for healthcare facilities to electronically submit surveillance data to the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This guide supports the CDC’s Data Modernization Initiative by using HL7 FHIR standards to streamline and automate public health reporting. It includes FHIR profiles, example digital quality measures, and technical specifications that enable facilities or external evaluation engines to report data efficiently and accurately. The goal is to reduce reporting burden, enhance data quality, and improve the speed of public health surveillance.

This IG builds upon previous efforts like the Quality Measure and Data Exchange for Quality Measures Implementation Guides, transitioning from static reporting formats to a more dynamic, measure-driven approach. It outlines the technical requirements for data submission, including privacy and security considerations, and emphasizes the importance of NHSN enrollment and compliance with data-use agreements. While the guide provides the technical foundation for reporting, it does not define the administrative processes for NHSN participation, which are managed separately by the CDC
