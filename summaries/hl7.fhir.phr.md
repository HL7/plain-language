The Personal Health Record (PHR) Implementation Guide creates a standardized way for patients to collect and control their complete medical history from all their doctors and hospitals in one digital file. Unlike hospital-owned medical records, PHRs belong to the patient and solve the problem of having health information scattered across different healthcare systems that don't communicate with each other. The guide uses FHIR, a common healthcare data standard, to organize all health information consistently and defines special secure file formats that can hold everything from basic patient details to lab results, medications, and medical images. This system allows patients to easily share their complete medical history with any healthcare provider while maintaining strong security protections, ultimately giving patients better control over their healthcare and helping doctors provide better care by having access to comprehensive medical histories.
